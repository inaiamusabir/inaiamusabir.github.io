        <p class="intro-text">Discover essential tips for successfully planting and caring for peonies. From selecting the perfect location to providing proper support and maintenance, this guide offers step-by-step instructions to ensure your peony plants thrive and bloom abundantly season after season.</p>

      <div class="container">
        <div class="fact">
          <h2>1. Choose the Right Location</h2>
          <p>Select a site with well-draining soil and full sun to partial shade. Peonies thrive in areas with at least six hours of sunlight daily.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="fact">
          <h2>2. Prepare the Soil</h2>
          <p>Ensure the soil is rich, fertile, and well-drained. Incorporate organic matter such as compost or aged manure to improve soil structure and fertility.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="fact">
          <h2>3. Planting Depth</h2>
          <p>Dig a hole approximately 2 feet wide and 1 foot deep. Place the peony root with the eyes (buds) facing upwards, and position it so that the eyes are no more than 2 inches below the soil surface.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="fact">
            <h2>4. Spacing</h2>
            <p>Space peony plants at least 3 to 4 feet apart to allow for proper air circulation and future growth.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="fact">
            <h2>5. Watering</h2>
            <p>After planting, water thoroughly to settle the soil around the roots. During the growing season, provide regular watering, especially during dry spells, to keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="fact">
            <h2>6. Mulching</h2>
            <p>Apply a layer of mulch, such as straw or shredded bark, around the base of the plant to conserve moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature.</p>

          <div class="fact">
            <h2>7. Support</h2>
            <p>Depending on the variety, peonies may benefit from staking to support the heavy blooms. Install stakes or supports early in the growing season to avoid damaging the roots later on.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="fact">
            <h2>8. Fertilization</h2>
            <p>In early spring, apply a balanced fertilizer or a fertilizer specifically formulated for flowering perennials according to package instructions to promote healthy growth and abundant blooms.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="fact">
            <h2>9. Pruning</h2>
            <p>Remove spent blooms promptly to encourage continuous flowering and prevent seed production, which can divert energy away from flower production.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="fact">
            <h2>10. Winter Care</h2>
            <p>In colder climates, provide winter protection by applying a layer of mulch or straw around the base of the plant after the ground freezes. This helps insulate the roots from extreme temperatures.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="fact">
            <h2>11. Pest and Disease Management</h2>
            <p>Monitor peony plants regularly for signs of pests such as aphids or diseases like powdery mildew. Treat any infestations promptly with appropriate methods, such as insecticidal soap or fungicides, to prevent damage to the plants.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="fact">
            <h2>12. Division</h2>
            <p>Every few years, consider dividing mature peony plants to rejuvenate them and promote better flowering. Divide the plant in early fall when it is dormant, ensuring each division has several healthy buds and roots for successful transplanting.</p>
